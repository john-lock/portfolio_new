-ISS Tracker
-
-
-This is a simple application that takes data from Open Notify (open-notify.org) for the current location and occupants of the International Space Station (ISS). Using Google Maps API the coordinates are then overlaid a map, with the list of current occupants displayed also. 

ISS Tracker was meant as a exercise in connecting to external API's and being able to consume the data retrieved. This also extends a personal interest in space - particularly ways in which programming can bring us closer to the topic.
